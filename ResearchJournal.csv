left,Aziiata(A-3-i),Fashion designer,"A-3-i is engaged in fashion design. This is the personal webpage she created for herself. Her web page is extremely simple, and she extensively uses the art of leaving blank space to showcase her personal fashion design works involving minority cultures and colonial experiences. The most distinctive interaction idea is that when the mouse hovers over the video, the content of the video will switch. A-3-i makes watching videos an intervention behavior, aiming to endow 'mouse hover' as a mining tool for viewers to trigger their hidden content. When designing my web page, I will consider how to arrange the relevant content reasonably but interestingly. The web page of A-3-i provides me with new ideas.","""./image/a3i.png""",,The personal website of A-3-i.,,https://a-3-i.com/,CreativeCoding #Style #Interactive
left,"Banister,Cyan",Venture Artist,"This is an interactive web page that showcases the creative pixel style, which comes from the personal website created by Cyan Banister as an artist for herself. This website constructs a hybrid style between computer files and pixel games. I think this breaks the scrolling framework and logically disperses the content across the interface. These forms stimulate the viewers' desire to explore. Among them, the most notable feature is that Cyan has set up sticky notes that can be dragged by the mouse and placed the content within the sticky notes. Different color labels represent different themes. Cyan guides users to visually combine and read the content independently. Unlike the traditional web page layout, I really like this kind of visual system web page that simulates the computer interface.","""./image/2908b5af321243303c5279edd17173b.png""",,The personal webpage homepage of Cyan Banister.,,https://cyanbanister.com/,Website #Style
left,BRAVIS INTERNATIONAL,The total branding company,"Bravis is an international brand company with strategy, creativity and digitalization as its core values. Its web design ingeniously integrates visual arts with its brand strategy. Bravis' web pages adopt bubble shapes as linked modules. Each bubble has its own function and presents the effect of connecting or combining with other bubbles when the mouse is swiped, which enhances the correlation between contents and the overall visual aesthetics. Bravis uses bubbles as its visual language, symbolizing the company's adaptability and spirit of cooperation in the face of diverse customer demands. This inspired me to use the effects produced by hovering and clicking the modules with the mouse to enhance the structure of the web page rather than just the text. Not only that, Bravis flexibly uses bubbles as emotional links, reminding me to design emotional visual experiences to guide viewers to understand my concepts. Although I think the appearance of too many similar bubbles on Bravis' website may affect viewers' information reception, this design way of thinking is inspiring.","""./image2/b7268468ca13e92aa83901f1c8407fc.png""",,From the website of Bravis International,,https://www.bravis.com/en/features/,Website #Style

It will speak when humans are silent or constantly interfere with the conversation when humans are speaking.

As traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes the methods of observation, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and palpation, as well as the accumulation of experience, to generate prescriptions for patients, while ai merely relies on data and statistics to determine patients' needs. Does this device really enable people to discover a way of integration? In this device, the audience can see how different herbs are allocated and assembled into prescriptions by AI.This device compares traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions with those generated by artificial intelligence, encouraging the audience to think about the future of traditional Chinese medicine.

left,Film roll,The technique of recording images,"On the Ethos Media website, I found that the website was designed to present the portfolio in the form of film roll. When the mouse scrolls, it is like playing a roll of a movie, intensifying the purpose of visual narrative. I think film roll is something with a sense of presence. When it becomes a virtual object on the Internet, it seems to control the viewing angle and time of the viewers, which means that their presentation is for the guiding purpose of the designer. The element of film roll inspired me to apply it to web pages. I think this is beneficial for me to build content modularization.","""./image/344b60c849d36a417b331eed615c7e2.png""",,Ethos Media website: https://www.awwwards.com/sites/ethos-media-agency.,,https://ethosmediaagency.com/,Technique #Website

The element of insects is not like web buttons and pictures that are reasonably arranged in web pages. It is more like a virus that damages web pages and confuses viewers. On Rozi Zhu's webpage, the insects hidden among the text will circle in place when the mouse hovers over. This game-like interaction that triggers viewers has greatly stimulated users' interest in participation.","""./image/9f114c710432d9efbb3ed64f0cb1a82.png""",,The personal website of Rozi Zhu.,,https://rozi.design/,CreativeCoding #Interactive

In her works, the frequently appearing elements are polka dots and bright colors.I was very lucky to visit Yayoi Kusama's art exhibition held at NGV in Melbourne. Among them, I was particularly interested in the art installation ""Flower Obsession"". People were invited to fill the red room with red flowers, and they became part of the participation in decorating the room. In this space, the line of sight repeatedly shows bright flowers, as if the whole world is filled with red flowers, and I am also submerged in the ocean of flowers. Such a stunning visual effect inspired me to apply it to my web page production. I find that using linked flowers as elements of web pages can help enhance the interactive effect and create visually appealing effects.","""./image/2c20de19119b8ebc4841034966bb102.png""",,"Flower Obsession,Yayoi Kusama.",,,CreativeCoding #Contemporary #Style #Interactive
left,Latent,A dynamic installation with the theme of the mechanical and natural world produced by Chok Si Xuan,"""Latent"" is composed of a large number of mechanical flowers and airbags. All the elements hang naturally from the ceiling like vines. During this process, the mechanical flowers and airbags contract and expand slowly like flowers, which uses machinery to simulate the concretization of natural breathing. I think this installation intuitively perceives the form aesthetics of mechanical bionics. While watching, the audience constantly wanders between plants and machinery, which guides them to slow down their breathing to sense the changes in time and rhythm, and encourages them to feel the synchronous breathing with nature. This work provides inspiration for the visualization of breathing. First of all, breathing is not only a physiological action but also a perceptible visual experience. The installation uses mechanical and soft materials to simulate the state of plants, blurring the boundary between the artificial and the natural. The slow expansion and contraction of the flowers guide the audience into a meditative state, and breathing is endowed with the symbol of resisting the fast pace.","""./image/9c2ea7717084cc6d0a1a4b211c88563.jpg""",,"Latent, Chok Si Xuan.
